# MLAlgos
This project includes custom implementations of various machine learning algorithms, all built from scratch using NumPy. You'll also find Jupyter notebooks that explain more complex topics, like the basics of word embeddings or how graph convolutional networks operate. The implementation of the neural network package is inspired by Andrej Karpathy.

## Installation

For installing the needed packages use the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notebooks
1. [Word Embedding](./notebooks/word_embeddings.ipynb)
2. [LLM Inference-time parameters](./notebooks/llm_inference_time_parameters.ipynb)
3. [Log probabilities](./notebooks/log_probabilities.ipynb)
4. [Graph Convolutional Networks](./notebooks/graph_convolutional_network.ipynb)
